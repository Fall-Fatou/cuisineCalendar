Cuisine Calendar is a web application that allows users to create recipes and their meal plan of the week. The project was built using the Django web framework with Python.

Recipe Creation: To create a new recipe, go to the "Add a new recipe" page. This will take you to a form where you can enter the recipe's title, description, ingredients, and instructions. Once you've entered all the necessary information, click "Create" to create your recipe.

Plan Creation: To create a new plan, go to the "Add a new meal plan" page. This will take you to a form where you can enter the day of the week, the meal-type and the recipe for this meal. Once you've entered all the necessary information, click "Create" to create your plan.

Meal plan and Recipe Browsing: To browse recipes, go to the "Recipes" page. This will take you to a page that displays all the recipes that have been published on the site. For now, recipes are displayed in the order in which they were published, and cannot be sorted or filtered.

Limitations: Cuisine Calendar is still a work in progress and there are some limitations to the site at the moment. For example, there is no user authentication system yet, which means anyone can add, edit, or delete recipes or meal plan.

Conclusion: Cuisine Calendar is a platform for food enthusiasts to create their meal plans for the week. With a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features, it allows users to easily create and browse meal plan.
